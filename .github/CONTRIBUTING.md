## What is this?

These guidelines help contributors to our projects understand our workflow and
how to contribute to our projects. Following these guidelines helps communicate
that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open
source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing
your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.


## Contribute what?

There are different ways to contribute to a project. Some ways to contribute
are…

* Writing code
* Submitting bug reports / feature requests
* Improving documentation
* Writing tutorials / blog posts


## Ground rules

These ground rules are the basic responsibilities for contributing to the
project.

* **DO's**
    * DO run unit tests before submitting a pull request
    * DO create issues first for major changes / enhancements you want to make
        * Discuss things transparently first and get community feedback
    * DO keep each pull request to _one_ feature / bug fix
        * If you want to submit multiple things, submit multiple pull requests
    * DO write unit tests for new features
    * DO write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
* **DON'Ts**
    * DON'T commit changes to files irrelevant to your pull request (e.g.
	  `gitignore`)


## Getting started

_Hint_:  **Working on your first pull request?** Learn how from this _free_
series. [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) 

1. Fork the project to your GitHub account.
2. Create changes in your fork.
    * Run unit tests once you're done! (`npm test`)
3. Send a pull request to our repo.


## Report a bug

When filing an issue, answer these five questions:

1. What version of NodeJS / npm are you using (`npm version`)?
2. What operating system are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?


## Code review process

The core team at the UNICEF Office of Innovation reviews pull requests on a
weekly basis. The core team may vary – see an updated list [on the MagicBox
wiki](https://github.com/unicef/magicbox/wiki/Project-index).

Expect a response on new pull requests **within five business days** (Mon-Fri).
If you don't receive any feedback, please follow up with a new comment!
